        <td >The Web Development class teaches the foundations of computer science, basic programming, and web design. Students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills as well as learning the basics of programming for the web, using JavaScript. This class also introduces students to the wide world of Web development, with a particular focus on mobile devices. Students learn how to design and build a website using HTML + CSS + Bootstrap and build responsive web sites suitable for all devices. This class is a combination of a web-based curriculum that students use to learn the core concepts and to practice these skills doing assignments, as well as a live environment, a cloud-based web server. Students are given a space on the web server and learn a whole host of development skills while creating their final project, building a responsive website from scratch. Students learn about the mechanics of web servers and hosting, how collaboration is done using GitHub, building to spec, and of course, the coding skills to actually complete their project.</td>
        <td>In mathematics education, precalculus is a course that includes algebra and trigonometry at a level which is designed to prepare students for the study of calculus. Schools often distinguish between algebra and trigonometry as two separate parts of the coursework.</td>

            Poetry can be dangerous. It can be absurd, lyrical, bold, wild, subtle, musical, personal and political. It can play with language; it can take risks; it can move us to laughter or tears and everything in between. What are the limits of poetry? Where do our impulses to write poetry come from and how do we harness these impulses? In this writing workshop, students practice the craft of poetry through their own writing and through the reading of published works. The class is conducted workshop style: Students regularly share and respond to each other’s writing. Emphasis is placed on revision and the writing process, as well as experimentation and risk taking with language, form, voice and imagery.

            Brooklyn born film director Spike Lee has engaged some of the most pressing American questions related to race, class, and gender, all while subverting and reimagining the history and future of American cinema. This course revolves screenings of a range of Lee’s films, from the now classic Do the Right Thing’s portrayal of racial and class conflicts in 1980s Brooklyn, Mo’ Better Blues foray into New York’s jazz scene, to When the Levees Broke, a documentation of the aftermaths of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. Other film selections could include: He Got Game, Bamboozled, and Crooklyn.  To contextualize the film screenings, students explore the histories of American film, particularly around its representations of race, socio-economic class, and gender. Students also explore two major African American film movements: the LA Rebellion and Blaxploitation. Students build a vocabulary for discussing film theory, genre, and aesthetic choices as we reflect and write about the film screenings. Students read selections of critical writings on film and representation and selected works of literature in the preparation of research papers.

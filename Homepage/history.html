            Have you ever felt that you were in “a dark wood” where “the straight way was lost”? Have you wondered about the consequences of evil and the need to expiate sin? What is hell like, in the imagination of a great poet? Dante’s “Inferno,” the first part of his three-part “Divine Comedy,” explores these issues and many more, such as political exile, the evils of banking, and the attractions of sin. In Dante’s long poem of astonishing sweep and drama, we encounter cruelty, tragedy, personal fidelity, passionate love, and heartbreaking betrayal in equal measure. This course’s trip through Dante’s underworld explores the historical setting in which Dante worked, demands a close reading of the poem itself, and draws on the many references to Dante’s great poem in contemporary music, visual arts and literature.

        Democracy in America, is a firsthand sociopolitical observation of the United States written by French lawyer Alexis de Tocqueville in 1831. The author documents his travels through America and contrasts his experiences with established aristocratic systems in Western Europe. This enduring classic explores the civil institutions and unprecedented individual freedoms held dear by citizens in both free and slave states. Democracy in America continues to be a masterful study investigating the constructive and adverse consequences of democracy.

                Hi, my name is Marcus Jabari Moise, and this is my website. I am currently an 11th grader at Elisabeth Irwin Highschool, also known as LREI. I designed this website to be an interactive experience in which you can feel free to learn about my backstory and look through some of my other projects. If you are here for job recruitment, I would like to inform you that this website will also act partially as my resume. I have job experience as a volunteer at Laurence Nursing Home where I worked for the entirety of the summer. I also acted as a volunteer organizer in a non-for-profit organization called Rockaway Youth Task Force. I am an active member of my schoolâ€™s Feminism Club, Students of Color Club, and a Co-Leader of the Black Student Union.

                I was born April 12th, 2003 in a Manhattan hospital. My mom said that as a baby, I quickly discovered the mechanics of my stroller seatbelt and would repeatedly disconnect it. Ever since I was able to speak and read, my mother had been homeschooling me as she took off from work for 3 years. She transformed the house into a learning center where times tables and periodic tables were on the walls and I was provided with a desk and my own bookshelf. When I reached the age of 4 I was admitted into Goldie Maple Academy's Pre-K. It was there that my mother was first introduced into the term "Gifted and Talented". After discovering that her old teacher had become the principle of her own school, my mom decided to admit me into P.S.232. It was there that I was introduced to scholarship programs such as Prep for Prep and A Better Chance. After multiple applications, I was admitted to A Better Chance in 5th grade and left my school for LREI's middle school, also known as Little Red. While in Little Red, I traveled on school trips to Virginia, Washington, and Spain, and continue to push myself academically in hopes of pursuing a college scholarship.

                My family, as large as it is, has become one of my main sources of guidance as well as my most important value. They continue to give me knowledge and advice for situations I have yet to encounter, but most surely will. My mom, to be specific, has been my most constant motivator, as she is always there in the crowd to cheer me on, and is always trying to make me pursue a new task that will come to my benefit for the future, specifically college and job applications. My father is also a constnt supporter, but in his own special way. His directness and coldness, though seemingly harsh to the viewers eye, is his way of telling me to remove all outside distractions and focus solely on my task. My grandmother on my father's side is undoubtably one of my favorite people in the world, as her simplistic life style shows me that joy does not come with wealth and material things, but rather the people that you chose to surround yourself with. My other grandmother, in her battle with dementia, has tought me the phrase "You only live once" holds true value, and that one must enjoy every moment to the fullest, because as hard as it is to remember something when it has passed, it is impossible to remember something that never happened.

                When I consider what my future goals are, the first thing that comes to mind is "In what ways can I improve the world". With the current state of the world, specifically with global warming, I hope to use my goal of coding to increase the popularity of ecofriendly products and recycling

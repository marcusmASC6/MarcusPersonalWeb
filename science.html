            What chemical reactions are happening in your body as you read this?  How do we get energy from the food we eat?  
Biochemistry is the study of living things at the molecular level.  Understanding biochemistry helps us to understand diverse topics such as diseases, genetics, evolution, and DNA.  It can help forensic teams solve crimes.  It is important to researching and creating treatments for various diseases.  This class is both an advanced-level chemistry class and a class that meets the biology requirement.  Topics include (but are not limited to) DNA, Evolution, Protein Structure and Function, and Energy.  The principle means of learning are laboratory investigations, hands-on activities, and projects.  Guest speakers and field trips are also included as time and resources permit.

           What is electricity? How is it produced? How is it used? What is “the grid”... and can it be hacked? In Sustainable Energy Use, students build from the ideas in 9th grade Chemistry and 10th grade Physics to develop an even more sophisticated understanding of energy and power so that they see how it is used on a city-, country-, and world-wide level. How do buildings, including our buildings here at LREI, use energy? How can we make that energy use more efficient and sustainable? What is renewable energy? Does NYC have a plan for the city’s future energy use? How are we working toward that plan? This class is interdisciplinary. In addition to the science involved, students also investigate the policy and economics, engineering applications, and activism related to sustainability and energy use.
